<div><p>&nbsp;We are pleased that you want to use the Oral-History.Digital platform (herein: "the platform") and its interview archives (herein: "the archives").</p>
<p>Maintaining data protection and security is a top priority for us when utilizing our platform and archives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With this Privacy Policies, we aim to inform you about the personal data collected by Freie Universität Berlin (herein: FU Berlin) and individual archive owners, and the purposes for which it is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) strengthens your user rights, and we inform you about them in <strong>point [9], "Rights of data subjects."</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You consent to the use of your data as described by accepting the privacy policy described in this notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to us at mail@oral-history.digital with any inquiries you may have regarding the safeguarding of your data.</p>
<h3>1. What is personal data?</h3>
<p>Personal data is information that may be used to identify you. This includes information such as your name, postal or IP address (unless anonymized) and email address. Information that may not be tracked back to your identity, such as anonymous log files that log the types of browsers used, is not included.</p>
<h3>2. Use of the platform "Oral-History.Digital" and the archives included</h3>
<p>When you use the platform and the archives, data is stored in the log files automatically created by the server.</p>
<p>This includes</p>
<ul>
  <li>the pages you visit on the platform and in the archives; from this, the functions used (e.g. workbook, tab, map, full text search) can be determined</li>
  <li>the page from which you came to us</li>
  <li>date</li>
  <li>time&nbsp;</li>
  <li>the operating system you are using</li>
  <li>the browser you are using (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we store the size of transferred data, an HTTP status code (to identify a successfully transferred webpage), and the IP address of the accessing device (such as a PC or smartphone). The IP address is anonymized by deleting its last octet.</p>
<p>The collection and use of the information stored in the log files serves only the anonymized evaluation for statistical purposes (for example, to analyze usage behavior, which functions of the platform and the archives are used, which archives are accessed, which browsers are used, etc.) and thus to improve our software. Since the IP addresses are anonymized as described above, it is not possible to assign the evaluation results to a specific IP address.<br>
 For the evaluation, the log files are stored for the current and previous calendar year. Afterwards, the data is deleted.</p>
<h3>3. Who stores the data?</h3>
<p>The personal data processed in the above-mentioned manner (see 1. and 2.) are collected electronically and used by the FU Berlin, and stored in the FU Berlin data center.</p>
<p>When you request activation for an archive included in Oral-History.Digital, your registration data will be made available to the archive owners responsible for the respective archive, who will then decide on your access. The archive owners have made a commitment to the FU Berlin to treat this information in accordance with data protection regulations.</p>
<p>Otherwise, your data will not be shared with third parties or processed outside of the FU Berlin unless we have your explicit consent (e.g., if you wish to access additional content) or are legally obliged or permitted to do so (e.g., within the process of legal prosecution, in cases of plagiarism, or other copyright violations).</p>
<h3>4. Processing of your registration data</h3>
<p>Permanently - i.e. at least as long as your registration exists - we store the personal data required for the use of our platform. These are those that you provide when you register for the platform, i.e. your first and last name, your e-mail address, your postal address (hereinafter: "registration data"). Furthermore, when you activate the use of some archives, information such as the institution for which you work, your activity, your research request or your reason for use (hereinafter: "activation data") is stored.</p>
<p>Your self-selected password is stored in encrypted form. You can change it at any time.</p>
<p>Your registration and activation data will only be processed by us to the extent necessary for your use, for example, to activate certain content, to assign certain roles, or to provide support in the event of usage problems. We may also use your registration data (especially your e-mail address) to communicate with you regarding this and other services of Freie Universität Berlin, for example, for usage evaluations or technical adjustments and improvements. By accepting this privacy policy, you consent to this kind of data processing.</p>
<h3>5. Processing of usage data</h3>
<p>We process data about the usage of the platform and the archives. We analyze this usage data in order to optimize the software of the platform and the archives.<br>
 The individual actions are assigned to the respective account. If you log in to the platform or one of the archives with your ID and use the functions there, usage data is collected. For the analysis and statistical evaluation of the use of the platform and the archives contained therein, we use the open source software Matomo. The collected usage data will be saved in pseudonymous usage profiles exclusively on the servers of the FU Berlin.</p>
<p>You can note search results, interviews or interview locations in your personal workbook and add comments to the interview locations. For this purpose, your user ID and the creation or last modification date are logged internally.</p>
<p>If you are granted further rights for individual archives by the archive owners, for example to edit individual interviews, the changes you make to the contents of the archive will be logged.</p>
<h3>6. Cookies</h3>
<p>Like other internet services we use so-called cookies. A cookie is a short entry in a specific data file on your computer. Cookies may store information about your visit on our platform. Our cookies do not contain personal data (like IP address or login data), but only anonymous “session ids”. Some of our cookies remain on your computer so the platform may recognize you at your next visit. Most browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera etc.) are set to accept cookies by default. You may however, change the settings on your browser to reject cookies or only accept them upon your approval. If you reject cookies altogether, the features of the platform and the included archives may not work properly.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Article 6, paragraph 1 of the EU-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<h3>7. Active components</h3>
<p>Java and Javascript applications are sometimes used on the Platform and the archives contained therein. You can set your browser - if necessary by using appropriate, freely available add-on programs - to refuse to run such applications or to ask you for confirmation before doing so. However, if you reject these applications, you may not be able to use certain features of the Platform and the included archives.</p>
<h3>8. Newsletter</h3>
<p>Some archives offer to subscribe to a free newsletter when you request activation. For this purpose, your e-mail address and the date of your activation will be transmitted to the person responsible for the content of the respective archives. You agree to the processing of this data by subscribing to the newsletter. The legal basis for the processing of data after subscription to a newsletter is Article 6, paragraph 1 of the EU-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if consent has been given. The collection of your e-mail address is used to deliver a newsletter. You can cancel the subscription to the newsletter at any time, in which case your e-mail address will no longer be stored for this purpose.</p>
<h2>9. Rights of data subjects</h2>
<p>You have the right to obtain from us information about the personal data and the information listed in detail in Article 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the right to request us to correct without undue delay any inaccurate personal data concerning you and, where applicable, to complete any incomplete personal data (Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
<p>You have the right to demand that we delete personal data relating to you without undue delay if one of the reasons listed in detail in Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation applies (right to erasure). We will then no longer process the personal data unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject.</p>
<p>You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data. Personal data may then only be processed if compelling legitimate grounds for the processing can be demonstrated which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)).</p>
<p>You have the right to revoke your data protection consent at any time. The revocation of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.</p>
<p>Please send any such requests or demands in writing (with signature) to the contact details below.</p>
<h3>10. Deletion of data upon terminating the user account&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As soon as your registration for the Oral-History.Digital platform is terminated, all personal data will be exchanged with placeholders. All personal data will thereby be anonymized and may then continue to be used for statistical evaluations. This anonymization of user data will block your access to the platform and the archives it contains. You can terminate your registration for the platform at any time and thus request anonymization of your data. To do so, write to the contact address below or by e-mail to <a href="mailto:mail@oral-history.digital">mail@oral-history.digital</a>.</p>
<h3>11. Changes in privacy policy</h3>
<p>Since changes in the law or changes in our internal processes may require an adjustment of this privacy policy, we ask you to read through this privacy notice regularly. However, we will also notify you of such changes on the website https://www.oral-history.digital/ or by e-mail and ask you - if required by law - for your consent to the changed practice. If you do not wish to consent to the changes, you are free to terminate your use of the platform and the archives at any time and have your registration deleted.</p>
